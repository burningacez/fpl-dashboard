### Live Event Types
The ticker tracks and displays these events in real-time:
- ⚽ Goals (with position-based points: DEF 6, MID 5, FWD 4)
- 👟 Assists (+3 pts)
- 🟨 Yellow cards (-1 pt)
- 🟥 Red cards (-3 pts)
- 🧤 Goalkeeper saves (+1 pt per 3 saves)
- 🔒 Defensive contributions (+1 pt)
- 🛡️ Clean sheets (+4 pts for GK/DEF)
- 💔 Clean sheet lost (-4 pts when team concedes)
- ⭐ Bonus points with BPS breakdown and position changes
- 😞 Goals conceded (-1 pt per 2 goals for GK/DEF)

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js with native `http` module (no Express)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS (no frameworks)
- **Data:** FPL API (fantasy.premierleague.com)
- **Storage:** Upstash Redis for visitor stats and archived seasons
- **Hosting:** Render.com

### Data Flow
1. Server fetches data from FPL API on startup and caches it
2. Cron jobs refresh data:
   - Every 2 minutes during live matches (7am-midnight UK)
   - Daily at 6am UK for full refresh
3. All API endpoints serve from cache for instant response
4. Pre-calculated data includes: manager profiles, hall of fame, tinkering impact, set-and-forget scores

## Important Caveats

### Startup Time (~6 minutes)
On server startup or daily refresh, the server pre-calculates data for all managers across all gameweeks:
- Fetches picks for every manager for every completed GW
- Calculates tinkering impact (what if you kept last week's team?)
- Calculates set-and-forget scores (what if you kept GW1 team?)
- Pre-caches processed picks for instant pitch view loading

**This only happens once per day (or on restart)**. During live matches, only lightweight data refreshes occur.

### What We Tried That Didn't Work

1. **Pre-calculating processed picks on startup** - Originally tried to pre-process all 600+ picks records (managers × gameweeks) with full player enrichment. This overwhelmed the server and caused timeouts. Solution: Only cache raw API data, process on-demand.

2. **Calculating tinkering during Hall of Fame requests** - Made Hall of Fame page timeout. Solution: Pre-calculate all tinkering data during daily refresh and store in cache.

3. **Checking cache after network calls** - Initial caching implementation checked cache AFTER calling bootstrap API, adding latency. Solution: Check cache BEFORE any network calls when GW parameter is provided.


## Environment Variables

Set these in Render dashboard:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `PORT` | No | Server port (default: 3001, Render sets automatically) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Yes | Password for admin panel (default: 'changeme') |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` | Yes | Upstash Redis REST URL for data persistence |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Yes | Upstash Redis REST token |
| `EMAIL_USER` | No | Gmail address for error alerts |
| `EMAIL_PASS` | No | Gmail app password for error alerts |

## Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run server
npm start

# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
```

For local development, create a `.env` file (not committed):
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token
ADMIN_PASSWORD=localpassword
```

## Key Server Functions

### Data Fetching
- `fetchBootstrap()` - Core FPL data (players, teams, events)
- `fetchManagerPicks(entryId, gw)` - Manager's team for a gameweek
- `fetchLiveGWData(gw)` - Live points data for a gameweek
- `fetchManagerHistory(entryId)` - Manager's full season history

### Pre-calculation (runs on startup/daily)
- `preCalculateManagerProfiles()` - Season stats for each manager
- `preCalculatePicksData()` - Cache raw picks and live data
- `preCalculateTinkeringData()` - "What if you kept last week's team?"
- `calculateSetAndForgetData()` - "What if you kept GW1 team?"
- `preCalculateHallOfFame()` - Season records and highlights

### Points Calculation
- `calculatePointsWithAutoSubs()` - Total points with auto-subs and provisional bonus
- `calculateProvisionalBonus()` - BPS-based bonus during live matches
- `calculateHypotheticalScore()` - Points for a hypothetical team in a given GW

### Live Event Tracking
- `liveEventState` - Stores previous state for change detection (bonus positions, clean sheets, defcons)
- `fetchWeekData()` - Extracts live events from fixtures and detects changes between polls
- Change events generated: `bonus_change`, `cs_lost`, `defcon_gained`

## Customization

### League ID
Change `LEAGUE_ID` constant in server.js (line 7) to your mini-league ID.

### Season
Update `CURRENT_SEASON` constant in server.js (line 10) each year.

### Loser Overrides
Edit `LOSER_OVERRIDES` object in server.js to manually set weekly losers.

### Prize Structure
Edit the rules in `rules.html` and earnings calculation in `fetchProfitLossData()`.

## Deployment

The project is configured for Render.com via `render.yaml`:
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect repo to Render
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy

First deployment takes ~6 minutes to pre-calculate all data.
